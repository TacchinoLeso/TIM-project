This is the second part of 2016 Hypermedia Applications project. The repository contains a fully responsive website based on the IDM Interactive Dialogue Models redacted in the design part of the project. All the data (images and textual informations) are retrieve asyncronously from an external server through PHP and MySQL scripts.

Working demo: http://timpolimi.altervista.org/

## Information

- CSS pages rely on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) library. The site template has been created manually from scratch and it is fully operative both in desktop and mobile vew.
- Images and text informations are stored in the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database.
- JavaScript code relies on [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) library's functions.
- The web app has beenand deployed and  tested relying on [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/).

Note:
- There are some differences between mobile and desktop views. Some elements' displaying was reorganized to make the website more mobile friendly, but the ooffered functionalities are always the same regardless the view type.
- Not all the links indicated in the IDM are actually working in the website. These links are set to reduce opacity on mouse hover to distinguish them from the working ones, as stated in the project  requirements. This also applies for some links that are just placeholders and not in the IDM, included in the website only for design purposes (i.e. Mail, Carrello, etc.).
