# TIM Site
#### Hypermedia Applications Project (Part two) - 2016
##### Computer Engineering - Politecnico di Milano
#
This is the second part of an Hypermedia Applications project, the objective was to implement a fully responsive website from the IDM Interactive Dialogue Models redacted in the first part. The project requirements included to **retrieve all the data asyncronously** from an external server with a PHP and MySQL backend.

Working demo: http://timpolimi.altervista.org/

## Information

- CSS is written in [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) on top of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), the site template has been created manually from scratch and it is fully responsive.
- Almost all the images and text informations about devices and other descriptions are stored in the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database.
- The web app has been tested and deployed also on [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/).

Note: there are some differences on mobile/desktop due to lack of visibility, so we reorganized some buttons to be more mobile friendly.

You can download the **PhoneGap** build directly by scanning this:
